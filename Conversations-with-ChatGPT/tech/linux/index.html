<p><strong>You said:</strong></p>
<p>Linux has become a bigger part of my job.  I find opensource software really interesting.  I have been reading the linux repo to get a better understanding of how it is build.  It is interesting going through the pull requests.  Let's start with talking about opensource software.  How does opensource work?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong></p>
<p>Open-source software (OSS) is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. This model contrasts with proprietary software, where the source code is closed and only accessible to the original authors or specific licensees. Here’s a basic overview of how open-source software works:
1. Source Code Accessibility</p>
<pre><code>The source code of the software is made publicly available. This allows anyone to review the code, understand how it works, and modify it if needed.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Licensing</p>
<p>Open-source software is distributed under licenses that grant users specific rights, such as the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the software. Common open-source licenses include the GNU General Public License (GPL), MIT License, and Apache License. These licenses often have specific conditions, like requiring modifications to be shared under the same license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community Contributions</p>
<p>Open-source projects often have a community of developers who contribute to the project. Contributions can include bug fixes, new features, documentation, and more. Contributors typically submit their changes through pull requests, which are reviewed and merged by maintainers or other community members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborative Development</p>
<p>Development in open-source projects is usually collaborative. Anyone can contribute, and the best ideas or implementations are often chosen through consensus. This collaborative approach leads to diverse input and often results in robust and innovative software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparency and Trust</p>
<p>Because the source code is open, users can verify the software’s security, privacy, and functionality. This transparency builds trust among users, who can be assured that the software does what it claims to do without hidden malicious code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance</p>
<p>Many open-source projects have governance structures to manage contributions, set the project’s direction, and resolve conflicts. This can range from informal leadership by key contributors to formal organizations with elected leadership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forking</p>
<p>If a group of users disagrees with the direction of an open-source project, they can “fork” the project, creating a new version of the software based on the original code but taking it in a different direction. This is a fundamental right in the open-source model, ensuring that no single entity has total control over a project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business Models</p>
<p>Many companies use open-source software as part of their business model. They may offer the software for free but charge for services like support, custom development, or hosting. Others may use open-source software to build a community around a product, which they then monetize in other ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community Engagement</p>
<p>Open-source projects often have active communities where users and developers collaborate, share knowledge, and help each other. This community aspect is one of the most powerful elements of open-source software, leading to rapid innovation and widespread adoption.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By reading the Linux repository and going through pull requests, you’re engaging with the very heart of open-source development. You're seeing how code contributions are proposed, reviewed, discussed, and either merged or rejected, all in a transparent and community-driven manner.</p>
<p><strong>You said:</strong></p>
<p>What if people have different opinions?  How is conflict resolved?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong></p>
<p>In open-source projects, conflicts and differing opinions are quite common due to the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of contributors. Resolving these conflicts in a productive way is essential to the health of the project. Here are some common methods for resolving conflicts in open-source projects:
1. Discussion and Consensus</p>
<pre><code>Open Discussion: Contributors and maintainers engage in discussions, often in public forums like mailing lists, GitHub issues, or project-specific discussion boards. The goal is to reach a consensus by carefully considering all viewpoints. This process involves listening to concerns, weighing pros and cons, and finding a solution that satisfies the majority.
Consensus Building: In many cases, the project strives to reach a consensus among contributors. This doesn’t necessarily mean unanimous agreement, but rather a solution that most can accept, even if it’s not everyone’s first choice.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Maintainers’ Decisions</p>
<p>Role of Maintainers: Maintainers, who are often more experienced contributors or the original authors of the project, have the final say in many cases. They make decisions based on the overall vision and goals of the project. Their role is to balance the needs of the project with the contributions from the community.
Final Authority: If a consensus cannot be reached, maintainers may step in to make a decision. This decision is typically guided by the project’s roadmap, technical considerations, and the maintainers' understanding of the broader user base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voting</p>
<p>Community Voting: In some projects, particularly those with formal governance structures, decisions may be made through voting. Contributors with certain privileges (e.g., maintainers or long-time contributors) might have a say in the vote. Voting is often used for major decisions that affect the project’s direction or governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation of Guidelines</p>
<p>Contribution Guidelines: Many projects have documented guidelines that outline how decisions are made, how to submit contributions, and how conflicts should be handled. These guidelines provide a framework that contributors can follow, reducing ambiguity and helping to resolve conflicts before they escalate.
Code of Conduct: A code of conduct often accompanies contribution guidelines, setting expectations for respectful behavior and collaboration. This helps maintain a positive and constructive atmosphere in the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Escalation to Governance Bodies</p>
<p>Formal Governance: Larger projects may have formal governance bodies, such as steering committees or technical boards, to handle conflicts. These bodies are often elected by the community and have the authority to make binding decisions on contentious issues.
Mediation: Some projects may involve third-party mediators to help resolve particularly tough conflicts. This is less common but can be useful in complex disputes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forking</p>
<p>Forking the Project: If a conflict cannot be resolved and contributors strongly disagree with the project’s direction, they may choose to fork the project. This means creating a new version of the project, starting from the original codebase but moving in a different direction. Forking is a last resort and is usually done when the disagreement is about fundamental aspects of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect and Patience</p>
<p>Cultural Norms: Many open-source communities emphasize respect, patience, and understanding in discussions. Contributors are encouraged to approach conflicts with an open mind, recognizing that diverse opinions can lead to better outcomes.
Constructive Feedback: Providing constructive feedback rather than criticism helps in resolving conflicts amicably. It’s common for contributors to request changes or suggest alternatives in a way that fosters collaboration rather than division.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In open-source projects, conflict resolution is as much about communication and community norms as it is about technical decisions. The open nature of these projects allows for transparency in how conflicts are handled, which helps build trust within the community.</p>
<p><strong>You said:</strong></p>
<p>How does opensource software make money?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong></p>
<p>Open-source software can generate revenue in several ways, despite the software itself often being available for free. Here are some common business models that open-source projects and companies use to make money:
1. Support and Services</p>
<pre><code>Paid Support: Companies or developers offer paid support services for their open-source software. This can include installation, configuration, customization, troubleshooting, and ongoing maintenance. Businesses that rely on the software often pay for expert support to ensure their systems run smoothly.
Consulting: Some open-source companies or developers offer consulting services to help organizations implement and optimize the software for their specific needs.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hosting and Managed Services</p>
<p>Cloud Hosting: Companies can offer hosted versions of their open-source software as a service. For example, WordPress offers a free, self-hosted version of its software, but also provides a hosted version (WordPress.com) with premium features and services.
SaaS (Software as a Service): Some open-source projects are offered as SaaS products, where the software is hosted by the provider, and users pay for access and additional features, such as more storage, advanced functionality, or higher levels of support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual Licensing</p>
<p>Open-Source and Proprietary Licenses: Some companies use a dual licensing model, where the software is available under an open-source license for general use, but a separate proprietary license is required for commercial use, especially when integrating with proprietary systems or when enhanced features are needed.
Enterprise Editions: The open-source version may be free, but an enhanced "enterprise" edition with additional features, support, and tools is sold under a proprietary license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freemium Model</p>
<p>Basic Free Version with Paid Upgrades: The software is available for free with basic features, while advanced features, add-ons, or extensions are offered as paid options. This model is common in software that serves both individual users and businesses, like GitLab, which has a free community edition and paid versions with more features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donations and Crowdfunding</p>
<p>Individual Donations: Many open-source projects rely on donations from users and supporters. Platforms like Patreon, Open Collective, or GitHub Sponsors allow developers to receive financial support directly from the community.
Crowdfunding Campaigns: Projects sometimes launch crowdfunding campaigns on platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo to raise money for development, new features, or specific goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bounties and Grants</p>
<p>Bug Bounties: Companies or communities may offer bounties for fixing bugs, developing new features, or improving documentation. Developers earn money by completing these tasks.
Grants and Sponsorships: Open-source projects can receive grants or sponsorships from organizations, foundations, or companies that benefit from the software or wish to support its development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partnerships and Ecosystem Building</p>
<p>Commercial Partnerships: Companies that rely on open-source software may form partnerships with the original developers, funding the project in exchange for influence over its development, or to ensure compatibility with their own products.
Ecosystem Products: Companies can build an ecosystem around their open-source software, offering compatible hardware, plugins, or other products that work with the software and generate revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising and Affiliate Marketing</p>
<p>In-Software Advertising: Some open-source projects include unobtrusive ads within the software or on their websites to generate revenue.
Affiliate Links: Projects can earn money through affiliate marketing by recommending products or services related to the software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certification and Training</p>
<p>Certification Programs: Companies offer certification programs for professionals who want to demonstrate their expertise in using or deploying the software. These certifications are often recognized by employers and can command a fee.
Training Courses and Materials: Developers or companies offer paid training courses, workshops, or educational materials to help users learn how to use the software effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merchandise</p>
<p>Branded Merchandise: Popular open-source projects sometimes sell branded merchandise, such as t-shirts, mugs, stickers, or other items, to generate additional revenue and promote the project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These models can be combined, and many successful open-source projects leverage multiple revenue streams to support their development and sustainability. The flexibility of the open-source model allows for creative approaches to monetization while still maintaining the ethos of open collaboration and community-driven development.</p>

<p>I am thinking of contributing to Linux.  The barrier is high though.  There is so much attention on the project.  It is also steeped in its own set of domain knowledge.  There are so many acronyms.  Ive noticed most of the documentation is written in reStructuredText.  Does reStructuredText support hovering over text for alt tags?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong></p>
<p>reStructuredText (reST) is a lightweight markup language commonly used for technical documentation, particularly in Python and many open-source projects like Linux. Unfortunately, reStructuredText does not natively support hover text (like alt tags) in the same way that HTML does with the title attribute.</p>
<p>However, you can achieve similar functionality in some environments (like Sphinx, a documentation generator often used with reStructuredText) by using custom directives or extensions. Here are a few ways to approach it:
1. Using the :abbr: Role</p>
<pre><code>reStructuredText has an :abbr: role that can define abbreviations with an expanded form that some documentation tools (like Sphinx) will show when you hover over the abbreviation.
Example:

rst

This is an :abbr:`HTML (HyperText Markup Language)` document.

In this case, "HTML" would display "HyperText Markup Language" on hover in some renderers, depending on how the documentation is generated.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Custom Sphinx Extensions</p>
<p>If you're using Sphinx, you can write a custom extension that adds hover functionality to specific elements by injecting custom HTML or JavaScript. This approach requires more setup but can provide the functionality you're looking for.</p>

<p>You can also achieve hover text by injecting custom HTML and CSS/JavaScript into the generated documentation. This is a more manual approach and might not be supported out of the box in all reStructuredText environments, but it’s possible with some customization.
Example:</p>
<p>rst</p>
<p>.. raw:: html</p>
<p><span title="This is the tooltip text">Hover over me</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Inline Text as a Workaround</p>
<p>Another common approach in documentation is to provide the full explanation inline the first time an acronym or term is used. This can help readers who are unfamiliar with the terms.
Example:</p>
<p>rst</p>
<p>The :abbr:<code>API (Application Programming Interface)</code> is essential for...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While reStructuredText doesn’t natively support hover text as HTML does, these methods can help bridge the gap, especially when generating documentation with Sphinx or similar tools. If you’re contributing to Linux and documentation clarity is a concern, you might also consider adding a glossary or acronym list to help others who are navigating the same 
challenges.</p>

<p>My thought is to add a hover expansion and a link to the kernel newbies glossary for more info. https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelGlossary</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong></p>
<p>Your idea of adding a hover expansion along with a link to the Kernel Newbies glossary is a great way to make the documentation more accessible, especially for newcomers or those who aren’t familiar with the numerous acronyms and specialized terms in the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>To implement this, you can combine a custom directive or use the :abbr: role with a link to the glossary. Here's how you could approach it using reStructuredText with Sphinx:
1. Using the :abbr: Role with a Link</p>
<p>You can define abbreviations with a hover effect using the :abbr: role and combine it with a link to the glossary:</p>
<p>rst</p>
<p>The :abbr:<code>API (Application Programming Interface) &lt;https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelGlossary#API&gt;</code> is a key component...</p>
<p>In this example, "API" would expand to "Application Programming Interface" on hover, and clicking on it would take the reader to the corresponding entry in the Kernel Newbies glossary.
2. Custom HTML/CSS for Enhanced Hover</p>
<p>If you want more control over the hover effect, you could inject custom HTML and CSS using the .. raw:: html directive:</p>
<p>rst</p>
<p>.. raw:: html</p>
<p><a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelGlossary#API" title="Application Programming Interface">API</a></p>
<p>This approach gives you full control over how the hover text appears and allows you to directly link to the glossary.
3. Automating with Sphinx Extension</p>
<p>For a more scalable solution, especially if you plan to do this across many documents, you could create a Sphinx extension that automatically adds the hover text and links to the Kernel Newbies glossary based on defined abbreviations.
4. Glossary Links</p>
<p>Another option is to create a glossary section at the end of the document or in a separate file, where each term is linked to the Kernel Newbies glossary:</p>
<p>rst</p>
<p>.. glossary::</p>
<p>API
      Application Programming Interface. See the full definition on <code>Kernel Newbies &lt;https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelGlossary#API&gt;</code>_.</p>
<p>This approach would be very useful to other contributors as well, helping lower the barrier to entry and making the documentation more user-friendly. If implemented well, it could serve as a valuable resource in the Linux documentation ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>You said:</strong></p>
<p>The docs are mostly rendered in github.  Will the sphinx extension work for the webui in github?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT said:</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Sphinx extensions or custom reStructuredText features, like the ones discussed earlier, won’t directly work in the GitHub web interface. GitHub’s rendering of reStructuredText is more limited compared to what you can achieve with Sphinx, as it doesn't support custom directives, roles, or HTML injection. GitHub's renderer primarily supports basic reStructuredText features without the advanced functionality available in Sphinx.</p>
<p>However, you still have a few options:
1. Basic reStructuredText and Inline Links</p>
<pre><code>You can use standard reStructuredText to add inline links to the Kernel Newbies glossary, but you won’t be able to include hover text.
Example:

rst

The API (Application Programming Interface) is defined in detail on the `Kernel Newbies glossary &lt;https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelGlossary#API&gt;`_.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages with Sphinx</p>
<p>If the project is hosted on GitHub and you control the documentation build process, you could use GitHub Pages to serve the documentation generated by Sphinx. This way, you can take advantage of Sphinx's full capabilities while still hosting the project on GitHub.
This would involve setting up a Sphinx project, generating the HTML output, and then publishing it to GitHub Pages. Users would then access the more feature-rich documentation via a separate URL (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io/project-docs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltips with External Tools</p>
<p>While native GitHub rendering doesn’t support tooltips, you could consider providing more context within the documentation by linking terms to an external glossary or creating a simple tool that users can reference outside of GitHub.
You might create a small web service or static page that uses JavaScript to provide hover effects and links, though this would be outside the GitHub web UI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding Explanatory Footnotes</p>
<p>Another approach is to use footnotes or inline definitions within the text, which can be linked to external resources like Kernel Newbies.
Example:</p>
<p>rst</p>
<p>API [#] is a key component of the software.</p>
<p>.. [#] Application Programming Interface. See <code>Kernel Newbies glossary &lt;https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelGlossary#API&gt;</code>_.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown for Simplicity</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with Markdown, which is also supported on GitHub, you could switch to using Markdown for your contributions. Markdown is simpler but more limited than reStructuredText. However, it might be easier to manage on GitHub without needing special extensions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>markdown</p>

<li>
<p>Documentation Contribution Guidelines</p>
<p>You might also contribute to the project by suggesting a documentation convention where every acronym is linked to the Kernel Newbies glossary. This won’t provide hover text but will make the documentation more accessible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, while GitHub’s native reStructuredText rendering is limited, you can still provide valuable links to external resources like the Kernel Newbies glossary to help readers understand the content. If full Sphinx features are critical, hosting the documentation separately via GitHub Pages might be the best solution.</p>
