# Hobbies

## Cooking

I have enjoyed cooking ever since I was a kid.  I would hover around my Grandma's ankles as she cooked away.  She would always make my favorite for my birthday, spaghetti bolongese.  I turned that passion into a career during college.  I had a realization as I moved up in the kitchen world though, the higher you move up the less it is about the food and the more it is about managing a business.  Managing a business is rewarding, but the drive behind my passion comes from the joy of creating things.  A friend suggested I look at coding as a change of pace when I expressed my frustration.  I was hooked once I switched and haven't looked back.  At times I do miss working in a kitchen, but I am happier coding.

In 2011 I worked the banquets at the Hyatt.  My boss was cool enough to let me take pictures as I worked.  The blog still exists here - https://everydaychefin.blogspot.com/

## Basketball

Basketball has been a passion of mine since I was a small child. I love the combination of strategy, skill, and athleticism that the game demands.  It is my favorite way to get cardio.  I am excite for the return of the SuperSonics.

## Chess

Chess is a hobby that challenges my mind and helps me improve my strategic thinking. I enjoy slow casual games.  I play D4 with white and the London with black.  Checkout my profile on chess.com and send me a challenage if you like - https://www.chess.com/member/bweez1337

## Astronomy

Astronomy has always captivated me with its vastness and the mysteries of the universe. I enjoy spending nights stargazing, learning about constellations, and understanding the science behind celestial events. I have a small telescope that I use to observe planets, the moon, and other deep-sky objects. Recently, I've been diving into astrophotography, trying to capture the beauty of the night sky through my lens.

My long term retirement goal is to create an astronomy STEM camp.  We will sail to the San Juan Islands using the stars.  Discussing the history of astronomy.  Once at the San Juans we will camp and make observations.  I will link to a blog post exploring the details when I write it.
