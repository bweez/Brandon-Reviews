# Streamlining MkDocs Deployment on GitHub Pages: Fixing Common Errors

Doing some blog maintenance today.  It's behaving oddly whenever I deploy. I am using GitHub pages and a python tool called Mkdocs.  I need to better understand the deployment scripts built into Mkdocs.  It seems to do a build and deploy step on GitHub that adds extra commits.  Whenever I push code I need to pull the changes.  Sometimes it will deploy an old version of the blog as well.

**ChatGPT said:**

It sounds like the issue might be related to how MkDocs handles the deployment process on GitHub Pages. MkDocs uses a built-in command called mkdocs gh-deploy, which handles the build and deployment process. Here's a breakdown of how it works and some potential points where things might be going wrong:

    Build and Deploy Steps:
        When you run mkdocs gh-deploy, MkDocs first builds your site locally by generating the static HTML files.
        It then pushes these files to a separate gh-pages branch on your GitHub repository, which GitHub Pages serves as your website.

    Extra Commits:
        Each time you run mkdocs gh-deploy, it generates a new commit on the gh-pages branch. This could explain why you see extra commits.
        If your local repository isn’t in sync with the remote gh-pages branch, you might need to pull these changes after pushing your code.

    Old Versions Being Deployed:
        This might happen if there’s an issue with the build process, like if the old build artifacts aren’t being properly cleaned before the new build is deployed.
        It could also be related to caching issues either locally or on GitHub’s servers.

Steps to Troubleshoot:

    Check the gh-pages Branch:
        Verify that the gh-pages branch is up to date and doesn't have any old commits that might be causing the issue.

    Ensure a Clean Build:
        Before running mkdocs gh-deploy, try deleting the site/ directory (or whatever directory you’re using for the build) to ensure that old files aren’t being reused.
        Use the command mkdocs build --clean to make sure it’s starting from a fresh state.

    Investigate the Deployment Script:
        Check if you have any custom deployment scripts or hooks that might be interfering with the default MkDocs process.
        Make sure your deployment command (mkdocs gh-deploy) is being run correctly and isn’t being overridden by another process.

    Consider Using GitHub Actions:
        Instead of relying solely on mkdocs gh-deploy, you could set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment process. This would give you more control and might help avoid the issues you’re facing.

    Debugging Old Versions:
        If old versions keep deploying, try checking your GitHub Pages settings to see if there’s any misconfiguration there. Also, clear your browser cache to rule out any local caching issues.

Here is my bash history:
    1  mkdocs gh-deploy --help
    2  mkdocs build --help
    3  mkdocs build --clean
    4  git add .
    5  git commit -m "Aug 18th blog post"
    6  git pull origin gh-pages
    7  git push origin gh-pages
This triggered a build in GitHub Actions.  I didnt run the mkdocs gh-deploy.  This cause an old version of my docs to be deployed.

It looks like the issue is rooted in the sequence of commands you've run. Here's a breakdown:

    Commands Overview:
        You ran mkdocs build --clean, which cleans and builds the static files for your site but does not deploy them.
        After that, you added and committed changes to the gh-pages branch and pushed them directly.
        This triggered a GitHub Actions build, but since you didn’t run mkdocs gh-deploy, it might have used an older build, leading to the deployment of an old version of your docs.

    Why This Happened:
        The mkdocs build --clean command only builds the site locally; it doesn’t handle the deployment to GitHub Pages.
        By pushing directly to the gh-pages branch without running mkdocs gh-deploy, you likely overwrote the contents of the branch with an older build or an incomplete state, which GitHub Actions then deployed.

    Suggested Workflow:
        Always use mkdocs gh-deploy: This command handles both the build and the deployment process, ensuring that the latest version of your site is deployed to the gh-pages branch.
        Avoid manually committing to the gh-pages branch: Let mkdocs gh-deploy manage the contents of that branch to prevent inconsistencies.
        GitHub Actions: If you're using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment, make sure it’s configured to run mkdocs build or mkdocs gh-deploy correctly. You might need to adjust your workflow to ensure it deploys the latest version.

    Fixing the Issue:
        Rebuild your site using mkdocs build --clean.
        Run mkdocs gh-deploy to push the latest version to GitHub Pages.
        If necessary, update your GitHub Actions workflow to ensure it deploys the correct version.

where do I see the definition of the action in GitHub?  It seems to be deploying the main branch instead of the gh-pages branch

To view and edit the GitHub Actions workflow, you'll need to check the .github/workflows/ directory in your repository. Here's how you can find it and verify what branch it's deploying:
Steps to Access the Workflow:

    Navigate to Your Repository:
        Go to your GitHub repository on the web.

    Locate the Workflow File:
        In the repository, look for the .github directory. Inside it, you'll find a workflows folder.
        The workflows folder contains YAML files that define the GitHub Actions workflows. The file responsible for your deployment might be named something like deploy.yml, gh-pages.yml, or similar.

    Check the Workflow Configuration:
        Open the relevant YAML file. Look for the following key sections:
            on:: This section defines the triggers for the workflow, like push, pull_request, or a specific branch.
            jobs:: This section contains the steps that GitHub Actions will run. Look for steps related to building and deploying your site.

    Branch Configuration:
        Look for any references to the main branch in the workflow file. It might be something like:

        yaml

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    If the workflow is set to run on main but deploy to gh-pages, there should be a step where it checks out the gh-pages branch or pushes to it.

Modifying the Workflow:

    If you find that it's deploying from the main branch and you want to deploy from gh-pages, you can modify the workflow file to check out the gh-pages branch before running the build and deploy commands.
    For example:

    yaml

        jobs:
          deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
              with:
                ref: gh-pages
            - name: Build and Deploy
              run: |
                mkdocs gh-deploy

Common Workflow Configurations:

    Checkout the correct branch: Ensure that the workflow checks out the gh-pages branch if that's where the deployment should occur.
    Deploying correctly: Make sure the workflow runs the mkdocs gh-deploy command to handle both the build and the deployment.
