Doing some blog maintenance today.  It's behaving oddly whenever I deploy. I am using GitHub pages and a python tool called Mkdocs.  I need to better understand the deployment scripts built into Mkdocs.  It seems to do a build and deploy step on GitHub that adds extra commits.  Whenever I push code I need to pull the changes.  Sometimes it will deploy an old version of the blog as well.

**ChatGPT said:**

It sounds like the issue might be related to how MkDocs handles the deployment process on GitHub Pages. MkDocs uses a built-in command called mkdocs gh-deploy, which handles the build and deployment process. Here's a breakdown of how it works and some potential points where things might be going wrong:

    Build and Deploy Steps:
        When you run mkdocs gh-deploy, MkDocs first builds your site locally by generating the static HTML files.
        It then pushes these files to a separate gh-pages branch on your GitHub repository, which GitHub Pages serves as your website.

    Extra Commits:
        Each time you run mkdocs gh-deploy, it generates a new commit on the gh-pages branch. This could explain why you see extra commits.
        If your local repository isn’t in sync with the remote gh-pages branch, you might need to pull these changes after pushing your code.

    Old Versions Being Deployed:
        This might happen if there’s an issue with the build process, like if the old build artifacts aren’t being properly cleaned before the new build is deployed.
        It could also be related to caching issues either locally or on GitHub’s servers.

Steps to Troubleshoot:

    Check the gh-pages Branch:
        Verify that the gh-pages branch is up to date and doesn't have any old commits that might be causing the issue.

    Ensure a Clean Build:
        Before running mkdocs gh-deploy, try deleting the site/ directory (or whatever directory you’re using for the build) to ensure that old files aren’t being reused.
        Use the command mkdocs build --clean to make sure it’s starting from a fresh state.

    Investigate the Deployment Script:
        Check if you have any custom deployment scripts or hooks that might be interfering with the default MkDocs process.
        Make sure your deployment command (mkdocs gh-deploy) is being run correctly and isn’t being overridden by another process.

    Consider Using GitHub Actions:
        Instead of relying solely on mkdocs gh-deploy, you could set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment process. This would give you more control and might help avoid the issues you’re facing.

    Debugging Old Versions:
        If old versions keep deploying, try checking your GitHub Pages settings to see if there’s any misconfiguration there. Also, clear your browser cache to rule out any local caching issues.

Here is my bash history:
```bash
    1  mkdocs gh-deploy --help
    2  mkdocs build --help
    3  mkdocs build --clean
    4  git add .
    5  git commit -m "Aug 18th blog post"
    6  git pull origin gh-pages
    7  git push origin gh-pages
```
This triggered a build in GitHub Actions.  I didnt run the mkdocs gh-deploy.  This cause an old version of my docs to be deployed.

**ChatGPT said:**

It looks like the issue is rooted in the sequence of commands you've run. Here's a breakdown:

    Commands Overview:
        You ran mkdocs build --clean, which cleans and builds the static files for your site but does not deploy them.
        After that, you added and committed changes to the gh-pages branch and pushed them directly.
        This triggered a GitHub Actions build, but since you didn’t run mkdocs gh-deploy, it might have used an older build, leading to the deployment of an old version of your docs.

    Why This Happened:
        The mkdocs build --clean command only builds the site locally; it doesn’t handle the deployment to GitHub Pages.
        By pushing directly to the gh-pages branch without running mkdocs gh-deploy, you likely overwrote the contents of the branch with an older build or an incomplete state, which GitHub Actions then deployed.

    Suggested Workflow:
        Always use mkdocs gh-deploy: This command handles both the build and the deployment process, ensuring that the latest version of your site is deployed to the gh-pages branch.
        Avoid manually committing to the gh-pages branch: Let mkdocs gh-deploy manage the contents of that branch to prevent inconsistencies.
        GitHub Actions: If you're using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment, make sure it’s configured to run mkdocs build or mkdocs gh-deploy correctly. You might need to adjust your workflow to ensure it deploys the latest version.

    Fixing the Issue:
        Rebuild your site using mkdocs build --clean.
        Run mkdocs gh-deploy to push the latest version to GitHub Pages.
        If necessary, update your GitHub Actions workflow to ensure it deploys the correct version.

where do I see the definition of the action in GitHub?  It seems to be deploying the main branch instead of the gh-pages branch

**ChatGPT said:**

To view and edit the GitHub Actions workflow, you'll need to check the .github/workflows/ directory in your repository. Here's how you can find it and verify what branch it's deploying:
Steps to Access the Workflow:

    Navigate to Your Repository:
        Go to your GitHub repository on the web.

    Locate the Workflow File:
        In the repository, look for the .github directory. Inside it, you'll find a workflows folder.
        The workflows folder contains YAML files that define the GitHub Actions workflows. The file responsible for your deployment might be named something like deploy.yml, gh-pages.yml, or similar.

    Check the Workflow Configuration:
        Open the relevant YAML file. Look for the following key sections:
            on:: This section defines the triggers for the workflow, like push, pull_request, or a specific branch.
            jobs:: This section contains the steps that GitHub Actions will run. Look for steps related to building and deploying your site.

    Branch Configuration:
        Look for any references to the main branch in the workflow file. It might be something like:

        yaml

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    If the workflow is set to run on main but deploy to gh-pages, there should be a step where it checks out the gh-pages branch or pushes to it.

Modifying the Workflow:

    If you find that it's deploying from the main branch and you want to deploy from gh-pages, you can modify the workflow file to check out the gh-pages branch before running the build and deploy commands.
    For example:

    yaml

        jobs:
          deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
              with:
                ref: gh-pages
            - name: Build and Deploy
              run: |
                mkdocs gh-deploy

Common Workflow Configurations:

    Checkout the correct branch: Ensure that the workflow checks out the gh-pages branch if that's where the deployment should occur.
    Deploying correctly: Make sure the workflow runs the mkdocs gh-deploy command to handle both the build and the deployment.

I am using the GitHub Pages built in actions.  Configuring them is a bit different than the typical Actions.  I dont have any files defined in the repo itself.

**ChatGPT said:**

When you're using GitHub Pages with the built-in GitHub Pages deployment actions, there are no explicit workflow files like the typical GitHub Actions in the .github/workflows directory. Instead, the configuration is managed through the repository settings and the default GitHub Pages settings.
Here's how you can check and adjust the configuration for GitHub Pages:

    Go to Repository Settings:
        Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
        Click on the "Settings" tab (usually on the top right).

    Access GitHub Pages Settings:
        Scroll down in the "Settings" tab until you find the "Pages" section, typically located under the "Code and automation" section.
        Here, you'll see the configuration for GitHub Pages.

    Check the Source Branch:
        In the "Source" section, you can select the branch and folder that GitHub Pages should use to serve your site.
        If it's set to main, then GitHub Pages is deploying the site from the main branch. You might want to change this to gh-pages if that’s where you want your MkDocs site to be deployed.

    Change the Source to gh-pages:
        If your MkDocs build is intended to be deployed from the gh-pages branch, select gh-pages as the source.
        Ensure the folder is set to / (root) unless you’ve specifically configured your build output to a different directory.

    Understanding the Built-in GitHub Pages Action:
        When you push to the branch specified in the GitHub Pages settings (e.g., main or gh-pages), GitHub automatically triggers a build and deploys the site.
        If your repository has GitHub Pages enabled, but you’re still seeing an old version of your site, it could be due to the branch selection or caching issues.

    Troubleshooting Steps:
        If you're experiencing issues with old versions deploying, make sure the selected branch in the Pages settings matches where your latest build files are located.
        You can also clear the build cache by going to the Pages settings and saving the settings again without making any changes (this forces a rebuild).

Recap:

    Ensure that the correct branch is selected under the GitHub Pages settings (gh-pages if that’s where your site should deploy).
    No need to define any explicit GitHub Actions workflow files since GitHub Pages handles it automatically based on your repository settings.

If you still encounter issues or need more details on adjusting these settings, feel free to ask!

Ok I think I figured out what I was doing wrong.  I had been committing changes directly to the gh-pages branch which is meant strictly for deployments.  All the code committed to it should come just from the build and deploy steps from mkdocs gh-deploy command.  The problems came from me switching to it and merging things from the main branch.

**ChatGPT said:**

That makes perfect sense. The gh-pages branch is indeed intended to be a deployment branch, so manually merging or committing changes to it can lead to issues like deploying old versions or creating unnecessary conflicts.

To avoid this in the future:

    Stick to the mkdocs gh-deploy Command: Always use the mkdocs gh-deploy command to handle deployments, which ensures that the gh-pages branch is updated properly.

    Work on the main Branch: Make all your changes and commits in the main branch (or your primary working branch). When you're ready to deploy, run the mkdocs gh-deploy command, which will take care of building the site and pushing it to the gh-pages branch.

    Avoid Direct Manipulation of gh-pages: Treat the gh-pages branch as a managed branch—only allow the mkdocs gh-deploy command to update it.

This should prevent the issues you were experiencing and ensure a smoother deployment process. If you run into any more challenges, I'm here to help!
