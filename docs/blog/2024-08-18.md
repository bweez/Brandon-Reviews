# Streamlining MkDocs Deployment on GitHub Pages: Fixing Common Errors

Doing some blog maintenance today.  It's behaving oddly whenever I deploy. I am using GitHub pages and a python tool called Mkdocs.  I need to better understand the deployment scripts built into Mkdocs.  It seems to do a build and deploy step on GitHub that adds extra commits.  Whenever I push code I need to pull the changes.  Sometimes it will deploy an old version of the blog as well.

It sounds like the issue might be related to how MkDocs handles the deployment process on GitHub Pages. MkDocs uses a built-in command called mkdocs gh-deploy, which handles the build and deployment process. Here's a breakdown of how it works and some potential points where things might be going wrong:

    Build and Deploy Steps:
        When you run mkdocs gh-deploy, MkDocs first builds your site locally by generating the static HTML files.
        It then pushes these files to a separate gh-pages branch on your GitHub repository, which GitHub Pages serves as your website.

    Extra Commits:
        Each time you run mkdocs gh-deploy, it generates a new commit on the gh-pages branch. This could explain why you see extra commits.
        If your local repository isn’t in sync with the remote gh-pages branch, you might need to pull these changes after pushing your code.

    Old Versions Being Deployed:
        This might happen if there’s an issue with the build process, like if the old build artifacts aren’t being properly cleaned before the new build is deployed.
        It could also be related to caching issues either locally or on GitHub’s servers.

Steps to Troubleshoot:

    Check the gh-pages Branch:
        Verify that the gh-pages branch is up to date and doesn't have any old commits that might be causing the issue.

    Ensure a Clean Build:
        Before running mkdocs gh-deploy, try deleting the site/ directory (or whatever directory you’re using for the build) to ensure that old files aren’t being reused.
        Use the command mkdocs build --clean to make sure it’s starting from a fresh state.

    Investigate the Deployment Script:
        Check if you have any custom deployment scripts or hooks that might be interfering with the default MkDocs process.
        Make sure your deployment command (mkdocs gh-deploy) is being run correctly and isn’t being overridden by another process.

    Consider Using GitHub Actions:
        Instead of relying solely on mkdocs gh-deploy, you could set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment process. This would give you more control and might help avoid the issues you’re facing.

    Debugging Old Versions:
        If old versions keep deploying, try checking your GitHub Pages settings to see if there’s any misconfiguration there. Also, clear your browser cache to rule out any local caching issues.
