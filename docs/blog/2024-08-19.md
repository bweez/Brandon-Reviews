## Introduction

As bloggers, we often look for ways to monetize our content without compromising the user experience. One effective method is to add ad blocks to your blog, allowing you to generate revenue while maintaining the integrity of your site. In this post, I’ll walk you through how I added an ad block to my MkDocs blog and share some tips to help you do the same.
Why Add an Ad Block?

Before diving into the implementation, it's essential to understand the benefits of adding an ad block to your blog:

    Monetization: Ads are a straightforward way to earn income from your blog.
    Control: By managing ads directly, you have full control over the content and placement, ensuring they align with your blog's theme and audience.
    Flexibility: You can choose ad networks that suit your audience, or even sell ad space directly to companies in your niche.

Step 1: Choosing the Right Ad Network

First, decide which ad network you want to use. Google AdSense is a popular choice for many bloggers due to its ease of use and broad reach. However, there are other networks like Media.net, PropellerAds, and BuySellAds that may suit your needs depending on your audience.

For this tutorial, I'll demonstrate how to integrate Google AdSense into an MkDocs blog.
Step 2: Getting Your Ad Code

Once you've signed up for an ad network, you'll need to generate the ad code. This code is usually a snippet of HTML and JavaScript that you can embed into your blog.

In Google AdSense, for example:

    Log in to your AdSense account.
    Navigate to Ads > Overview.
    Click on Get Code for the ad unit you want to use.
    Copy the provided HTML/JavaScript code.

Step 3: Integrating the Ad Block into MkDocs

Now that you have your ad code, the next step is to integrate it into your MkDocs blog.

    Locate the appropriate template file: MkDocs uses a theme directory that contains HTML templates. For most themes, the primary template file is main.html. This is where you'll insert your ad code.

    Edit the main.html file:
        Locate the theme directory in your MkDocs project.
        Open main.html in a text editor.
        Find the location where you want to display the ad (e.g., before the footer, after the header, or within the content).
        Insert the ad code snippet you copied from your ad network.

```html

<!-- Ad Block Start -->
<div class="ad-container">
    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
         style="display:block"
         data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXX"
         data-ad-slot="XXXXXX"
         data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
    <script>
         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
    </script>
</div>
<!-- Ad Block End -->
```
Styling the Ad Block: You may want to style the ad block to match your blog’s theme. Add custom CSS in the extra_css section of your mkdocs.yml file.

```yaml

extra_css:
    - css/custom.css
```
Then, in your custom.css file:

```css

.ad-container {
    margin: 20px 0;
    text-align: center;
}
```
Build and Deploy: Once you've added the ad code and customized the styling, build your MkDocs site by running:

```bash

mkdocs build
```
Then deploy your site using:

```bash

    mkdocs gh-deploy
```
Step 4: Testing and Optimization

After deploying your blog, ensure the ad block displays correctly across different devices and browsers. Use tools like Google Chrome's Developer Tools to simulate mobile devices and check responsiveness.

You may also want to experiment with the placement and format of your ads to see what works best in terms of user engagement and revenue.
Conclusion

Adding an ad block to your MkDocs blog is a simple but effective way to monetize your content. By following the steps outlined above, you can integrate ads seamlessly into your blog, providing value to both you and your readers.

Implementing the Code

Here’s a quick guide to help you implement the ad block on your MkDocs blog:

    Locate main.html:
        Navigate to your MkDocs project’s theme directory. If you’re using a custom theme, this file should be within that directory.
        If you're using the default theme, you may need to create a main.html template under a custom theme directory in your project.

    Insert the Ad Code:
        Open main.html and paste the ad code snippet in the desired location within the HTML structure.
        Save the file.

    Update CSS (if necessary):
        Add any custom CSS to your extra_css in mkdocs.yml and include the CSS file in your project.

    Deploy Your Blog:
        Run mkdocs build to generate the static files.
        Use mkdocs gh-deploy to publish your updated site.

That’s it! Your blog should now display ads as configured. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further customization.

**You said:**
Ad block sounds too much like ad blocker, I think that is confusing.  What should I call it instead?

**ChatGPT said:**

You're right; "ad block" could be confusing. A more clear and concise term could be "ad unit" or "ad placement." These terms are commonly used in advertising and accurately describe the space or section where the ad is displayed.

Here’s how the revised sections would look:

Step 3: Integrating the Ad Unit into MkDocs

Now that you have your ad code, the next step is to integrate it into your MkDocs blog.

    Locate the appropriate template file: MkDocs uses a theme directory that contains HTML templates. For most themes, the primary template file is main.html. This is where you'll insert your ad code.

    Edit the main.html file:
        Locate the theme directory in your MkDocs project.
        Open main.html in a text editor.
        Find the location where you want to display the ad unit (e.g., before the footer, after the header, or within the content).
        Insert the ad code snippet you copied from your ad network.

```html

<!-- Ad Unit Start -->
<div class="ad-container">
    <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
         style="display:block"
         data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXX"
         data-ad-slot="XXXXXX"
         data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
    <script>
         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
    </script>
</div>
<!-- Ad Unit End -->
```
Styling the Ad Unit: You may want to style the ad unit to match your blog’s theme. Add custom CSS in the extra_css section of your mkdocs.yml file.

```yaml

extra_css:
    - css/custom.css
```
Then, in your custom.css file:

```css

.ad-container {
    margin: 20px 0;
    text-align: center;
}
```
Build and Deploy: Once you've added the ad code and customized the styling, build your MkDocs site by running:

```bash

mkdocs build
```
Then deploy your site using:

```bash

    mkdocs gh-deploy
```
This change should make the terminology clearer and avoid any potential confusion with "ad blockers."

How should I setup the Google AdSense account?  Do I need to open it under a business? 

**ChatGPT said:**

When setting up a Google AdSense account, you have the option to register it as either an individual or a business. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide which option is best for your situation:
1. Setting Up as an Individual

    Simplicity: Setting up as an individual is straightforward and quicker. If you're a sole proprietor or running a personal blog, this is usually sufficient.
    Payment: Payments will be made to you personally, using your name as the payee.
    Tax Information: You'll need to provide your personal tax information, such as your Social Security Number (SSN) in the U.S.
    When to Choose: This is ideal if you're managing the blog as a hobby, side project, or personal endeavor without formal business registration.

2. Setting Up as a Business

    Professionalism: Registering under a business name can lend credibility, especially if you plan to scale your blog or run multiple websites.
    Payment: Payments are made to the business name, and you'll need to provide your business tax ID (like an EIN in the U.S.).
    Tax Benefits: Depending on your business structure, you may be eligible for tax deductions on business-related expenses.
    When to Choose: If your blog is part of a registered business, or if you have plans to scale into a more significant venture, this is the better choice.

Steps to Set Up Your Google AdSense Account

    Sign Up for Google AdSense:
        Visit the Google AdSense signup page.
        Use your existing Google account to sign up, or create a new one.

    Choose Account Type:
        Select Individual or Business as your account type.

    Provide Website Information:
        Enter your website URL (your MkDocs blog).
        Ensure that your blog complies with Google AdSense’s content policies.

    Enter Payment Information:
        For Individual: Provide your name and personal bank account details.
        For Business: Enter your business name, registered address, and business bank account details.

    Tax Information:
        Follow the prompts to provide your tax information.
        For Individuals: Use your SSN or equivalent personal tax ID.
        For Businesses: Use your EIN or equivalent business tax ID.

    Verify Your Account:
        Google will typically require identity verification and may send a PIN to your address.
        You'll also need to verify your website ownership by adding a code snippet to your MkDocs blog (this is similar to how you'd integrate an ad unit).

    Wait for Approval:
        Google reviews your site to ensure it complies with their policies. This can take a few days to a few weeks.
        Once approved, you can start creating ad units and integrating them into your blog.

Final Considerations

    Earnings Threshold: Google AdSense requires a minimum balance (usually $100) before payments are issued, regardless of whether you're an individual or a business.
    Tax Reporting: Remember that any earnings from AdSense are taxable, so ensure you keep records and report them accordingly.

Setting up under a business may offer more advantages if you foresee growing your blog into a larger operation, but for most personal bloggers, registering as an individual is sufficient.

Where in the markdown should I put this script from google adsense "<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-0206320615603992"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>"  I am working mainly in markdown that is compiled to html.

**ChatGPT said:**

When working with Markdown that compiles to HTML, you can still include HTML and script tags directly in your Markdown files. However, the placement of the script depends on how you want it to be applied across your site.
Option 1: Adding the Script in a Specific Markdown File

If you want to include the script on a specific page, you can insert it directly into the Markdown file where you want the ad to appear:

```markdown

### Your Blog Post Title

Some content here...
html
<!-- AdSense Script -->
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-0206320615603992"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<div class="ad-container">
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
         style="display:block"
         data-ad-client="ca-pub-0206320615603992"
         data-ad-slot="1234567890"
         data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
    <script>
         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
    </script>
</div>

```
Option 2: Adding the Script Site-Wide

If you want the script to be included on every page, you can add it to the main.html template file that MkDocs uses to generate each page. This approach ensures that the script is included globally.
Steps to Add the Script Site-Wide:

    Locate the main.html Template:
        This file is typically found in the theme directory of your MkDocs project. If you don’t have a custom theme, you might need to create a custom theme directory and copy the main.html file from the MkDocs default theme.

    Edit main.html:
        Open main.html in your text editor.
        Add the script tag within the <head> or <body> tag, depending on where you want the script to be loaded.

    ```html

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>{{ config.site_name }}</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ base_url }}/css/theme.css">

        <!-- AdSense Script -->
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-0206320615603992"
             crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Your content goes here -->
        {{ content }}

        <!-- Optional: Ad placement within the body -->
        <div class="ad-container">
            <ins class="adsbygoogle"
                 style="display:block"
                 data-ad-client="ca-pub-0206320615603992"
                 data-ad-slot="1234567890"
                 data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
            <script>
                 (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
            </script>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    Rebuild and Deploy Your MkDocs Site:
        After making these changes, run mkdocs build to regenerate your site with the updated template.
        Deploy your site using mkdocs gh-deploy.

Considerations:

    Script Placement: Placing the script in the <head> ensures it loads early, but if you're concerned about performance, placing it just before the closing </body> tag can help keep your site responsive by loading the script after the main content.
    Content Security Policy (CSP): If you have a strict CSP in place, ensure that the AdSense script is allowed, or it may be blocked.

By following these steps, you can successfully include Google AdSense in your MkDocs site, whether for specific pages or site-wide.
