# Creating Blog Post GPT: A Step-by-Step Journey

**You said:**

My blog is called Conversations with ChatGPT.  I want to improve my workflow for creating new articles.  There are a number of things I want you to do by default.  Should I setup a specific gpt to do this?  What is the best way to have a gpt with a default configuration?

**ChatGPT said:**

To streamline your workflow for creating new articles on your blog, you have a few options:
1. Custom GPT Configuration:

    Custom Instructions: You can provide custom instructions within the ChatGPT interface to set up a default configuration that aligns with your workflow. This includes setting up defaults for things like formatting, tone, and content structure.
    Custom GPT: If you're looking for a more tailored experience, you might consider creating a custom version of GPT that includes specific prompts, instructions, and behaviors. This custom GPT could be configured to handle tasks like drafting posts, suggesting improvements, and managing the formatting.

2. Using Automation Tools:

    Python Scripts: You could write Python scripts that interact with the GPT API to automate parts of your workflow. For example, you could script the creation of a new blog post, formatting the text, or even deploying the post directly to your site.
    Templates: You might consider setting up templates for different types of blog posts. These templates can include placeholders for the content, formatting guidelines, and other specific instructions that you want to follow for each post.

3. Tooling and Integrations:

    GitHub Actions: If you're using GitHub for version control, GitHub Actions can be set up to automate parts of your deployment process. For example, you could trigger a deployment whenever a new post is merged into the main branch.
    Markdown Editors with Extensions: Using a markdown editor that supports extensions or plugins, such as VSCode with Markdown extensions, can help automate formatting, linting, and previewing your posts before they go live.

4. Set Default Behavior in GPT:

    Memory Settings: While there's no persistent memory across all instances, you can set up specific instructions or contexts that get loaded every time you start a session. This could include a set of prompts or reminders that guide how you interact with the tool for your blog.

Next Steps:

    Custom Instructions: Consider setting up specific custom instructions in your current ChatGPT interface to optimize the interaction for your blog.
    Evaluate Automation: Look into automation tools like GitHub Actions or Python scripts to see how they might help.
    Experiment with Custom GPT: If you find that your needs are very specific, you might explore the possibility of creating a custom GPT instance for your workflow.

If you want to proceed with setting up any of these, I can help guide you through the steps.

**You said:**

I think a custom GPT would be the best way to go.  I like the idea of having a specific GPT I go to, to write a blog post.  It will keep it separate from my other work flows for things.  How should I do that?

**ChatGPT said:**

Setting up a custom GPT specifically for your blog posts is a great idea to keep your workflows organized and efficient. Here's how you can go about creating and configuring a custom GPT:
1. Explore OpenAI's API or GPT Customization Tools:

    OpenAI API: If you have access to the OpenAI API, you can create a custom GPT model that is pre-configured with the instructions and behaviors you want. This requires some coding, but it offers a high degree of customization.
    Custom GPT Builder: OpenAI offers a "Custom GPT" feature, where you can design a specific GPT with custom instructions. This can be done directly within the OpenAI platform without needing to code.

2. Steps to Create a Custom GPT:
Using OpenAI’s Custom GPT Builder:

    Create a New Custom GPT:
        Log in to your OpenAI account and go to the "Custom GPT" section.
        Start a new project specifically for your blog workflow.

    Configure Default Behavior:
        Instructions: Write specific instructions for how this GPT should behave. For instance:
            Default to Markdown formatting.
            Prioritize clarity and conciseness.
            Include reminders to check certain aspects (e.g., spelling, grammar, SEO considerations).
            Suggests a structure for blog posts (e.g., introduction, body, conclusion, call-to-action).
        Prompts: You can add prompts that the GPT will use as templates for different types of posts.

    Training Data (Optional):
        If you want to fine-tune the model further, you could provide examples of your past blog posts or specific content that aligns with your style.

    Testing and Iteration:
        Once configured, test your custom GPT by writing a few sample blog posts. Adjust the instructions and behaviors based on how well it performs.

    Deploy and Access:
        After finalizing the setup, your custom GPT will be accessible through the OpenAI interface. You can go directly to this GPT whenever you're ready to write a new blog post.

Using OpenAI API:

If you prefer more control:

    Set Up API Access:
        Ensure you have access to OpenAI’s API with the ability to create custom models.

    Create a Python Script:
        Write a Python script that interacts with the API. The script can:
            Load your custom instructions each time it runs.
            Allow you to input the blog topic, and the GPT will generate content based on your predefined guidelines.
        You can also integrate this with your existing workflow tools, like MkDocs or GitHub, to automate publishing.

    Fine-tune the Model:
        You can fine-tune your GPT model on a specific dataset if you want it to align closely with your writing style.

    Run and Iterate:
        Use your script whenever you're ready to write a blog post, and tweak the code as necessary to refine the behavior.

3. Ongoing Management:

    Version Control: Keep your configurations and any fine-tuning data under version control (e.g., using Git) to track changes.
    Feedback Loop: Continuously provide feedback to your custom GPT based on the posts it generates. This could be done manually or programmatically through the API.

4. Accessing Your Custom GPT:

    You’ll access your custom GPT directly from your OpenAI account or through the API script you’ve written. This separation ensures that your blog writing workflow remains distinct from your other tasks.

This approach should give you a powerful tool specifically tuned to your blogging needs while keeping it separate from other workflows. If you need help with any specific steps, such as writing the instructions or setting up the API, let me know!

## Switching to GPT Builder

*The GPT builder is another chat bot, imagine that.*

**GPT Builder said:**
