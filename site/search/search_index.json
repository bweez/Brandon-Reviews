How can we hope to solve the artificial one.  Despite this darker realization, I ended the book feeling hopeful.  In chapter 8 in a discussion on inference, the topic crossed over to something extremely salient to me.  Advertising.  I have been working in Ad tech for the last 2 years.  I hope to help build the bridge discussed between ads and preferences.  Should an alcohol ad be shone to an alcoholic?  An AI defined Ad manager could be tuned to improve peoples health.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024-08-16/#chatgpt-response","title":"ChatGPT response","text":"<p>The Alignment Problem by Brian Christian is a remarkable exploration of one of the most critical challenges we face in the age of artificial intelligence. On the surface, it seems like a tech book, but at its core, it delves deep into an inherently human problem: alignment.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024-08-16/#the-core-of-the-problem","title":"The Core of the Problem","text":"<p>At the heart of the book is the \"alignment problem\" itself: the difficulty in ensuring that AI systems do what we want them to do, even in complex and unforeseen situations. Christian breaks down the problem into three interconnected parts:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Technical Alignment Problem: This involves creating AI systems that can accurately interpret and execute human instructions. As AI becomes more sophisticated, the challenge lies in ensuring that these systems can handle ambiguity, conflicting objectives, and evolving goals.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Philosophical Alignment Problem: This aspect addresses the deeper questions of what it means for AI to align with human values. Whose values should be prioritized? How do we encode ethical considerations into machines? Christian explores the ethical frameworks that researchers are using to tackle these questions.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Social Alignment Problem: Finally, Christian discusses the broader societal implications of AI. As machines take on more roles traditionally held by humans, how do we ensure that these systems contribute positively to society? This section of the book examines the impact of AI on employment, privacy, and fairness.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Christian meticulously unpacks the alignment problem between humans and AI, but as I read through the book, I couldn't help but grapple with a more unsettling realization. We, as humans, haven't even solved our own alignment issues. How can we hope to align with something as complex and powerful as artificial intelligence when we struggle with alignment among ourselves?</p> <p>Yet, despite this darker revelation, I found myself feeling hopeful as I turned the last page. The journey through Christian's arguments isn't just about highlighting the problem; it's about illuminating the path forward. The discussions in chapter 8, particularly on inference, struck a chord with me because it touched on something deeply relevant to my work in Ad tech.</p> <p>For the last two years, I\u2019ve been immersed in the world of advertising technology, an industry where inference is not just a topic of discussion but a fundamental component of how things work. The chapter raises an important ethical question: Should an alcohol ad be shown to an alcoholic? It\u2019s a question that underscores the immense responsibility we have as developers, engineers, and product managers working in AI-driven industries.</p> <p>Imagine an AI-powered ad manager tuned not just to optimize clicks or conversions but to genuinely improve people's health. This isn\u2019t a far-fetched idea; it's a bridge that needs to be built between ads and preferences. We have the technology to make it happen, but it requires careful alignment\u2014both with our values and with the broader societal impacts.</p> <p>Building that bridge is part of the alignment problem we can tackle today. While solving human alignment might seem daunting, we can make significant strides in aligning AI with outcomes that benefit society. This is where the true potential of AI lies\u2014not just in mimicking or predicting human behavior, but in guiding and shaping it towards healthier, more aligned outcomes.</p> <p>As I continue my journey in Ad tech, I am motivated by the possibility of contributing to this alignment. Christian\u2019s book has reinforced my belief that while the challenges are immense, the opportunities for positive impact are even greater. Aligning AI with human values isn\u2019t just a technical challenge; it\u2019s a moral imperative. And it starts with the small steps we take in our daily work\u2014like tuning an ad manager to prioritize health over profit.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024-08-16/#key-takeaways","title":"Key Takeaways","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024-08-16/#the-challenge-of-encoding-human-values","title":"The Challenge of Encoding Human Values","text":"<p>One of the book's most compelling points is the difficulty of encoding human values into AI.

I want to use this conversation as a blog post, don't be too verbose, keep your responses more conversational.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>Sure thing, let's dive in! How do you see AI shaping the future of advertising, or do you have specific areas you're curious about?</p> <p>You said: Let's start with the real time bidding process.  OpenRTB is the standard currently.  There are many layers to how an ad auction is completed.  To keep things clear let's focus on the 3 main players, the Demand Side Provider (DSP), Supply Side Provider (SSP) and the end user. Let's examine how an AI bot will impact the everyday user first.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>Great place to start! AI\u2019s impact on the everyday user in the context of real-time bidding (RTB) can be pretty significant, even though most users might not realize it.</p> <p>Personalized Ad Experiences</p> <p>AI bots can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, including browsing history, behavior, and demographics. This allows the DSPs to serve highly targeted ads that are more relevant to the user. For example, if a user frequently visits travel websites, AI can identify this pattern and prioritize travel-related ads in real-time.</p> <p>Dynamic Ad Content</p> <p>AI can also create dynamic ad content tailored to the user. Instead of seeing a generic ad, the user might see one that\u2019s customized with the product, price, or promotion most likely to catch their attention. This kind of personalization can make ads feel less intrusive and more like useful suggestions.</p> <p>Improved Ad Frequency and Placement</p> <p>AI can help manage the frequency and placement of ads. By learning user behavior, AI can determine the best times and platforms to show ads, reducing the chances of overexposing the user to the same ad (which can be annoying) and instead showing it when it\u2019s most likely to be effective.</p> <p>Privacy Considerations</p> <p>On the flip side, AI's ability to gather and analyze data in such a detailed way raises privacy concerns. Users might feel uncomfortable with how much is known about them and how it\u2019s being used to target them, especially if they start noticing just how tailored the ads are.</p> <p>In summary, AI bots in RTB can enhance the ad experience for users by making it more relevant and less disruptive, but this also comes with a need for transparency and privacy safeguards.</p> <p>How does that sound for a start? Would you like to explore AI's impact on DSPs and SSPs next?</p> <p>You said: I am imagining something like a smart ad block agent.  The agent has access to all my information and make decisions on what ads to show me.  How would we preserve the privacy of the user?  A profile would need to be maintained somewhere.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>A smart ad block agent that curates ads based on user preferences while preserving privacy is an interesting concept. Here\u2019s how it might work:</p> <p>Localized User Profiles</p> <p>To maintain privacy, the user profile could be stored locally on the user\u2019s device rather than in the cloud. This profile would contain all the necessary information to make decisions about which ads to show, but it wouldn\u2019t be accessible to external servers or companies. The AI agent would operate within this local environment, using the data without ever transmitting it elsewhere.</p> <p>Federated Learning</p> <p>Federated learning could play a role in enhancing this system. In this setup, the AI model would learn from the data on the user\u2019s device and improve its ad selection process. The key here is that the model is updated across many devices, but only the learned insights (not the raw data) are sent back to a central server. This means the user\u2019s personal data never leaves their device, yet the model can still improve over time.</p> <p>Differential Privacy</p> <p>Differential privacy techniques could be applied to ensure that even if some data does need to be shared (for example, aggregated statistics to improve the ad model), it\u2019s done in a way that individual users can\u2019t be identified. This method adds a layer of noise to the data, making it difficult to trace any information back to a specific user.</p> <p>User Control and Transparency</p> <p>The user should have complete control over their profile. They could set preferences, see what data is being used, and opt-out of certain types of data collection or ad targeting. Transparency is key\u2014users should know what\u2019s happening with their data and why certain ads are being shown.</p> <p>Edge Computing</p> <p>Leveraging edge computing, where data processing occurs on the user's device rather than in centralized cloud servers, would also enhance privacy. The smart ad block agent could function efficiently without needing to send data back and forth over the internet, reducing the risk of data breaches or misuse.</p> <p>Blockchain for Data Integrity</p> <p>For added security and transparency, blockchain technology could be used to record interactions and data access. This would create a tamper-proof log that the user could audit to see how their data is being used, ensuring that the AI agent adheres to privacy standards.</p> <p>In summary, by keeping the user profile local, using federated learning, and employing privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy, we can create a system that gives users control over their ad experience without compromising their privacy.</p> <p>What do you think of this approach? Would you like to explore more about how this smart ad block agent might interact with DSPs and SSPs?</p> <p>You said: I am thinking the agent has some mechanism to influence the real time bidding.  The profile would need to be shared with the SSP.  How can we share information with a potentially untrustworthly 3rd party? </p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>Sharing information with a potentially untrustworthy third party, like an SSP, while maintaining user privacy is a tricky challenge. However, a few advanced techniques could help mitigate the risks:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)   Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow one party (the user\u2019s agent) to prove to another party (the SSP) that a statement is true without revealing the underlying information. In this context, the smart ad block agent could prove that a user falls into a certain category (e.g., \u201cinterested in travel\u201d) without revealing specific data. The SSP can then use this proof to tailor ad bids without accessing the actual profile details.</p> </li> <li> <p>Homomorphic Encryption   With homomorphic encryption, the user\u2019s data could be encrypted in such a way that the SSP can perform computations on it (e.g., deciding on ad relevance) without ever decrypting the data. The SSP would receive the encrypted profile, process it, and return the encrypted results. Only the smart ad block agent would be able to decrypt and use these results to influence the bidding process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)   In SMPC, data is split into pieces and distributed among different parties, so no single party has access to the entire dataset. The SSP could receive a piece of the user\u2019s profile data, while another piece is held by a trusted entity (or even split among multiple SSPs). They would collaboratively perform the bidding process without any party gaining full access to the user\u2019s profile.</p> </li> <li> <p>Differential Privacy in Data Sharing   By applying differential privacy, the profile shared with the SSP could be perturbed or anonymized so that individual user details are obscured. The SSP would receive data that is useful for ad targeting but doesn\u2019t reveal precise personal information. This ensures that even if the SSP is untrustworthy, they can\u2019t extract meaningful details about the user.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tokenization and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)   User data could be tokenized, meaning that sensitive data is replaced with non-sensitive equivalents (tokens) that the SSP can use without exposing the original data. Additionally, TEEs can be used where the SSP processes data in a secure, isolated environment that the SSP itself cannot tamper with. The smart ad block agent could share data securely within these environments, ensuring that only the intended use is possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Policy-Based Access Control   The smart ad block agent could enforce strict policies on how the SSP can access and use the data. This might involve contractual agreements backed by legal frameworks, combined with technical measures like access control lists (ACLs) and usage monitoring. The SSP would only receive the bare minimum information necessary for ad targeting, with all actions monitored and logged.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blockchain for Auditable Sharing   To add a layer of transparency and trust, blockchain technology could be used to record every instance of data sharing and processing. This would create an immutable log that both the user and third parties could audit to ensure compliance with agreed-upon privacy standards.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Anonymization and Aggregation   Rather than sharing raw profile data, the smart ad block agent could anonymize and aggregate the data before sharing it with the SSP. This approach ensures that the SSP can still make informed bidding decisions without access to specific, identifiable information.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By leveraging these techniques, the smart ad block agent can influence real-time bidding while minimizing the risk of exposing sensitive user data to untrustworthy SSPs. The key is finding the right balance between utility for the SSP and privacy for the user.</p> <p>Does this align with what you had in mind, or is there a specific method you\u2019d like to delve deeper into?</p> <p>You said: Can you see the current structure of an openrtb in json?  What parts would we be able to fill in?</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>In the current structure of an OpenRTB request, various fields are used to provide information about the ad request, the user, the context, and the inventory being bid on. The OpenRTB protocol is quite detailed, and the request is typically represented in JSON format.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a simplified example of an OpenRTB bid request in JSON:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"id\": \"1234567890\",\n  \"imp\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"1\",\n      \"banner\": {\n        \"w\": 300,\n        \"h\": 250,\n        \"battr\": [1, 2, 3]\n      },\n      \"bidfloor\": 0.5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"site\": {\n    \"id\": \"102855\",\n    \"domain\": \"example.com\",\n    \"cat\": [\"IAB1-1\"],\n    \"page\": \"http://example.com/home\"\n  },\n  \"device\": {\n    \"ua\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36\",\n    \"ip\": \"123.123.123.123\",\n    \"geo\": {\n      \"country\": \"USA\",\n      \"region\": \"CA\",\n      \"city\": \"San Francisco\",\n      \"zip\": \"94107\"\n    },\n    \"dnt\": 0,\n    \"lmt\": 0,\n    \"language\": \"en\"\n  },\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"55816b39711f9b5acf3b90e313ed29e51665623f\",\n    \"yob\": 1984,\n    \"gender\": \"M\",\n    \"geo\": {\n      \"country\": \"USA\",\n      \"region\": \"CA\",\n      \"city\": \"San Francisco\",\n      \"zip\": \"94107\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"at\": 2,\n  \"tmax\": 120,\n  \"cur\": [\"USD\"],\n  \"bcat\": [\"IAB25\", \"IAB7-28\", \"IAB8-5\", \"IAB8-18\"],\n  \"badv\": [\"example.com\"]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Parts Where the Smart Ad Block Agent Could Intervene</p> <pre><code>User Information (user)\n    User ID (user.id): The agent could decide whether to share a specific user ID or an anonymized version. This might involve using a hashed identifier or a pseudonymous ID.\n    Year of Birth (user.yob): The agent might obfuscate or generalize this information (e.g., providing an age range instead of a specific year).\n    Gender (user.gender): The agent could choose to share this information if it\u2019s relevant to the ad, or omit it entirely.\n    User Geo Data (user.geo): The agent could share generalized location data, such as only the country or region, to preserve privacy while still allowing for location-based targeting.\n\nDevice Information (device)\n    User Agent (device.ua): The agent might modify or generalize the user agent string to prevent fingerprinting.\n    IP Address (device.ip): Instead of sharing the exact IP, the agent could use a proxy or a VPN to mask the user\u2019s true location.\n    Do Not Track (device.dnt): The agent would ensure that the dnt flag reflects the user's preference regarding tracking.\n\nContextual Data (site)\n    Domain (site.domain): The agent could allow the sharing of this data since it's often necessary for contextual targeting. However, it could potentially provide a more generalized domain if privacy concerns arise.\n    Page (site.page): The agent might decide whether to share the specific page URL or a generalized version of it.\n\nImpression Data (imp)\n    Bid Floor (imp.bidfloor): The agent could influence the bid floor based on the user\u2019s preferences or perceived value of their data, effectively setting a minimum bid amount that it deems acceptable.\n    Blocked Creative Attributes (imp.banner.battr): The agent could decide which types of ads to block (e.g., autoplay videos, pop-ups) by setting specific creative attributes.\n\nBlacklists (bcat and badv)\n    The agent could manage lists of blocked categories (bcat) and advertisers (badv) based on the user\u2019s preferences, ensuring that only acceptable content is shown.\n</code></pre> <p>Sharing Sensitive Information</p> <p>When it comes to sharing sensitive information with the SSP:</p> <pre><code>Anonymization: Before sharing, the agent could anonymize or aggregate data to minimize the risk of identifying the user.\nEncryption: The agent might encrypt certain fields, allowing only authorized SSPs to decrypt and use the data.\nSelective Sharing: The agent could choose to share only the fields that are absolutely necessary for the SSP to process the bid, keeping more sensitive data either withheld or generalized.\n</code></pre> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>The smart ad block agent could fill in many parts of the OpenRTB structure while ensuring privacy. It would act as a gatekeeper, deciding what data to share, how to share it, and under what conditions, based on user preferences and privacy considerations.</p> <p>Does this breakdown help? Would you like to explore how specific fields might be managed in more detail?</p> <p>You said: What if we included an id for the agent.  This id would allow an agent pair.  The pair agent would exist on the DSP side, looking at the bid stream.  How could we leverage these two agents together?</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>Introducing an agent pair, one on the user side and one on the DSP side, opens up intriguing possibilities for enhancing both user privacy and ad targeting efficiency. Here\u2019s how these two agents could work together:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Secure and Coordinated Communication   The agent on the user\u2019s device could generate an ID that both agents recognize as a secure channel for communication. This ID would be unique to the user but wouldn't reveal their identity. When the user\u2019s agent sends data in an OpenRTB bid request, the DSP-side agent can recognize this ID and know that it\u2019s dealing with a trusted, privacy-preserving counterpart.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhanced Data Matching   Instead of sharing the full user profile with the SSP, the user-side agent could send an encrypted, minimal version of the profile data to the DSP-side agent. The DSP-side agent, having access to the bid stream and the DSP\u2019s models, could match this data against existing audience segments or bidding strategies without exposing the full profile to the broader system. This matching could include interests, behaviors, or contextual relevance based on data the DSP already holds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Real-Time Negotiation and Optimization   With an agent pair, real-time negotiation becomes possible. For example, the user-side agent could set parameters or preferences (e.g., a minimum bid floor, acceptable ad types, or preferred brands). The DSP-side agent could then negotiate with the DSP to meet these conditions, optimizing both the ad's relevance to the user and the bid's value to the advertiser.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Consent and User Control   The user-side agent could allow the user to adjust privacy settings on the fly, influencing what data is shared and under what conditions. The DSP-side agent could instantly adjust the bidding strategy based on these settings. If the user, for instance, toggles a preference to see fewer ads about a certain topic, the DSP-side agent could quickly recalibrate its targeting strategy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collaborative Filtering and Ad Personalization   The two agents could collaborate to refine ad personalization without sharing raw data. The user-side agent might know detailed personal preferences, while the DSP-side agent understands which ads perform best within certain contexts. By sharing insights (rather than raw data), they could co-create highly personalized ads that respect the user's privacy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Privacy-Aware Bidding Strategies   The DSP-side agent could implement privacy-aware bidding strategies based on signals from the user-side agent. For example, if the user\u2019s agent indicates a high privacy preference, the DSP-side agent might opt for less intrusive ad formats or avoid bidding altogether in scenarios where sensitive data might be at risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reporting and Feedback Loops   After an ad is served, the DSP-side agent could provide anonymized performance feedback to the user-side agent, which could help refine future targeting without compromising user privacy. This feedback loop ensures that both agents are continuously learning and optimizing, improving ad relevance over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trust and Transparency   The existence of the agent pair could be made transparent to the user, enhancing trust. The user could receive insights into how their data is being used and how ads are being selected. This transparency could be a key differentiator, making users more comfortable with ad targeting because they know an agent is working on their behalf.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regulation Compliance   Both agents could work together to ensure that all data processing and sharing comply with regulations like GDPR or CCPA. The user-side agent could enforce the user\u2019s rights (like data access or deletion requests), while the DSP-side agent could ensure that the DSP\u2019s operations remain compliant with these demands.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adaptive Ad Delivery   The DSP-side agent could adapt the delivery of ads based on real-time feedback from the user-side agent. If the user reacts negatively to a certain type of ad, the DSP-side agent can instantly adjust its strategy to avoid similar ads in the future, ensuring a more positive ad experience.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Implementation Considerations</p> <pre><code>Synchronization: The two agents would need a reliable and secure method to synchronize data and decisions, ensuring that the user experience is seamless.\nScalability: The system should be scalable, allowing millions of agent pairs to operate without causing delays or significant overhead in the ad bidding process.\nSecurity: Strong encryption and authentication mechanisms would be crucial to prevent malicious actors from hijacking the communication between the agents.\n</code></pre> <p>This agent-pair approach could revolutionize how ads are delivered, making the process more user-centric, privacy-conscious, and efficient. How does this align with your vision? Any specific areas you\u2019d like to explore further?</p> <p>You said: There are competing forces.  The profit motives of companies can often work against the best interest of the user.  I am thinking of addictive things like gambling and alcohol.  A user can work against there own interest.  I realize this is an impossible problem to solve, but what could these agents do to help?</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>You\u2019re absolutely right\u2014there\u2019s a delicate balance between profit motives and the best interests of users, especially when it comes to potentially addictive or harmful products like gambling or alcohol. While it might be impossible to fully solve this problem, the agent pair system could implement several strategies to mitigate the risks and help users make healthier choices.</p> <ol> <li> <p>User-Defined Boundaries and Preferences   The user-side agent could allow users to set boundaries around the types of content they wish to avoid, such as gambling or alcohol ads. These preferences could be enforced rigorously by the agent, preventing such ads from being shown even if they might be highly profitable for advertisers. The DSP-side agent would respect these boundaries, reducing the bid value or excluding these categories from the bidding process altogether.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ethical AI Principles   The agents could be designed to follow a set of ethical AI principles, prioritizing user well-being over short-term profit. For example, if the user-side agent detects that the user has a history of engaging with gambling content, it could take proactive steps to reduce the frequency of such ads, even if the user hasn't explicitly set a boundary. This could involve applying a higher threshold for allowing these ads through or dynamically adjusting the targeting criteria to minimize exposure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adaptive Ad Filtering   The user-side agent could implement adaptive filtering, learning from the user\u2019s behavior over time. If the agent notices that the user is frequently engaging with potentially harmful content, it could gradually reduce exposure to related ads. This wouldn\u2019t be an outright block but rather a subtle shift towards less risky content, helping to nudge the user in a healthier direction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Real-Time Health Indicators   The user-side agent could incorporate real-time health indicators or warnings, alerting users when they are exposed to potentially addictive content. For example, if a user frequently clicks on gambling ads, the agent could trigger a gentle reminder about the risks associated with gambling. This might not prevent the user from engaging but would provide a moment of reflection before proceeding.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collaborative Filtering with a Health Focus   The agent pair could collaborate to filter and prioritize ads that align with the user\u2019s long-term well-being. For example, the DSP-side agent could prioritize bids for ads related to healthier alternatives (e.g., mindfulness apps instead of gambling sites) when it detects that the user might be at risk of over-engaging with harmful content. The user-side agent would ensure that these alternatives are shown more frequently.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incentivizing Positive Behavior   The system could introduce a rewards mechanism for users who engage with healthier content. For example, if a user opts to watch a fitness-related ad instead of a gambling ad, they could receive some form of reward (e.g., loyalty points, discounts on related products). The DSP-side agent could adjust the bidding process to include these incentives, making healthier ad content more attractive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regulatory Compliance and Transparency   Both agents could enforce strict compliance with regulatory frameworks that govern advertising for harmful products. The user-side agent could give users access to tools that allow them to see exactly how their data is being used, and why certain ads are being shown. Transparency would empower users to make informed decisions about what they\u2019re exposed to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Risk Assessment   The agents could perform real-time risk assessments based on the user\u2019s behavior and history. If the user\u2019s behavior suggests a growing dependency on certain types of content (like frequent engagement with alcohol ads), the agents could dynamically adjust the ad targeting criteria to reduce exposure to those categories.</p> </li> <li> <p>Community and Peer Support Integration   The user-side agent could integrate with community or peer support systems. For example, if a user is at risk of developing a gambling problem, the agent could suggest community resources, helplines, or even block access to certain types of content during vulnerable times. The DSP-side agent could reinforce this by deprioritizing bids from categories that contribute to these risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incorporating User Feedback Loops   The user-side agent could allow users to provide feedback on the ads they see, specifically asking whether they found certain ads helpful or harmful. This feedback could then inform future ad targeting, helping the agents learn and adapt to better support the user\u2019s well-being.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>While it\u2019s impossible to completely eliminate the risks associated with addictive content, these strategies could help mitigate the impact and guide users toward healthier behaviors. By empowering users with more control, incorporating ethical principles, and leveraging AI\u2019s ability to learn and adapt, the agent pair could play a significant role in balancing profit motives with the user\u2019s best interests.</p> <p>Would you like to explore any of these ideas further, or add more to the mix?</p> <p>You said: What should we title this conversation?</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>Suggested Title: \"Balancing Privacy, Profit, and User Well-Being: The Role of AI Agents in Real-Time Bidding\"</p> <p>You said: Thanks chatgpt</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>You're welcome, Brandon!

It's behaving oddly whenever I deploy. I am using GitHub pages and a python tool called Mkdocs.  I need to better understand the deployment scripts built into Mkdocs.  It seems to do a build and deploy step on GitHub that adds extra commits.  Whenever I push code I need to pull the changes.  Sometimes it will deploy an old version of the blog as well.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>It sounds like the issue might be related to how MkDocs handles the deployment process on GitHub Pages. MkDocs uses a built-in command called mkdocs gh-deploy, which handles the build and deployment process. Here's a breakdown of how it works and some potential points where things might be going wrong:</p> <pre><code>Build and Deploy Steps:\n    When you run mkdocs gh-deploy, MkDocs first builds your site locally by generating the static HTML files.\n    It then pushes these files to a separate gh-pages branch on your GitHub repository, which GitHub Pages serves as your website.\n\nExtra Commits:\n    Each time you run mkdocs gh-deploy, it generates a new commit on the gh-pages branch. This could explain why you see extra commits.\n    If your local repository isn\u2019t in sync with the remote gh-pages branch, you might need to pull these changes after pushing your code.\n\nOld Versions Being Deployed:\n    This might happen if there\u2019s an issue with the build process, like if the old build artifacts aren\u2019t being properly cleaned before the new build is deployed.\n    It could also be related to caching issues either locally or on GitHub\u2019s servers.\n</code></pre> <p>Steps to Troubleshoot:</p> <pre><code>Check the gh-pages Branch:\n    Verify that the gh-pages branch is up to date and doesn't have any old commits that might be causing the issue.\n\nEnsure a Clean Build:\n    Before running mkdocs gh-deploy, try deleting the site/ directory (or whatever directory you\u2019re using for the build) to ensure that old files aren\u2019t being reused.\n    Use the command mkdocs build --clean to make sure it\u2019s starting from a fresh state.\n\nInvestigate the Deployment Script:\n    Check if you have any custom deployment scripts or hooks that might be interfering with the default MkDocs process.\n    Make sure your deployment command (mkdocs gh-deploy) is being run correctly and isn\u2019t being overridden by another process.\n\nConsider Using GitHub Actions:\n    Instead of relying solely on mkdocs gh-deploy, you could set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment process. This would give you more control and might help avoid the issues you\u2019re facing.\n\nDebugging Old Versions:\n    If old versions keep deploying, try checking your GitHub Pages settings to see if there\u2019s any misconfiguration there. Also, clear your browser cache to rule out any local caching issues.\n</code></pre> <p>Let me know if you want more specific guidance on any of these steps!</p> <p>You said:</p> <p>Here is my bash history: <pre><code>    1  mkdocs gh-deploy --help\n    2  mkdocs build --help\n    3  mkdocs build --clean\n    4  git add .\n    5  git commit -m \"Aug 18th blog post\"\n    6  git pull origin gh-pages\n    7  git push origin gh-pages\n</code></pre> This triggered a build in GitHub Actions.  I didnt run the mkdocs gh-deploy.  This cause an old version of my docs to be deployed.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>It looks like the issue is rooted in the sequence of commands you've run. Here's a breakdown:</p> <pre><code>Commands Overview:\n    You ran mkdocs build --clean, which cleans and builds the static files for your site but does not deploy them.\n    After that, you added and committed changes to the gh-pages branch and pushed them directly.\n    This triggered a GitHub Actions build, but since you didn\u2019t run mkdocs gh-deploy, it might have used an older build, leading to the deployment of an old version of your docs.\n\nWhy This Happened:\n    The mkdocs build --clean command only builds the site locally; it doesn\u2019t handle the deployment to GitHub Pages.\n    By pushing directly to the gh-pages branch without running mkdocs gh-deploy, you likely overwrote the contents of the branch with an older build or an incomplete state, which GitHub Actions then deployed.\n\nSuggested Workflow:\n    Always use mkdocs gh-deploy: This command handles both the build and the deployment process, ensuring that the latest version of your site is deployed to the gh-pages branch.\n    Avoid manually committing to the gh-pages branch: Let mkdocs gh-deploy manage the contents of that branch to prevent inconsistencies.\n    GitHub Actions: If you're using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment, make sure it\u2019s configured to run mkdocs build or mkdocs gh-deploy correctly. You might need to adjust your workflow to ensure it deploys the latest version.\n\nFixing the Issue:\n    Rebuild your site using mkdocs build --clean.\n    Run mkdocs gh-deploy to push the latest version to GitHub Pages.\n    If necessary, update your GitHub Actions workflow to ensure it deploys the correct version.\n</code></pre> <p>Let me know if you need further assistance or details!</p> <p>You said: where do I see the definition of the action in GitHub?  It seems to be deploying the main branch instead of the gh-pages branch</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>To view and edit the GitHub Actions workflow, you'll need to check the .github/workflows/ directory in your repository. Here's how you can find it and verify what branch it's deploying: Steps to Access the Workflow:</p> <pre><code>Navigate to Your Repository:\n    Go to your GitHub repository on the web.\n\nLocate the Workflow File:\n    In the repository, look for the .github directory. Inside it, you'll find a workflows folder.\n    The workflows folder contains YAML files that define the GitHub Actions workflows. The file responsible for your deployment might be named something like deploy.yml, gh-pages.yml, or similar.\n\nCheck the Workflow Configuration:\n    Open the relevant YAML file. Look for the following key sections:\n        on:: This section defines the triggers for the workflow, like push, pull_request, or a specific branch.\n        jobs:: This section contains the steps that GitHub Actions will run. Look for steps related to building and deploying your site.\n\nBranch Configuration:\n    Look for any references to the main branch in the workflow file. It might be something like:\n\n    yaml\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\nIf the workflow is set to run on main but deploy to gh-pages, there should be a step where it checks out the gh-pages branch or pushes to it.\n</code></pre> <p>Modifying the Workflow:</p> <pre><code>If you find that it's deploying from the main branch and you want to deploy from gh-pages, you can modify the workflow file to check out the gh-pages branch before running the build and deploy commands.\nFor example:\n\nyaml\n\n    jobs:\n      deploy:\n        runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n        steps:\n        - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n          with:\n            ref: gh-pages\n        - name: Build and Deploy\n          run: |\n            mkdocs gh-deploy\n</code></pre> <p>Common Workflow Configurations:</p> <pre><code>Checkout the correct branch: Ensure that the workflow checks out the gh-pages branch if that's where the deployment should occur.\nDeploying correctly: Make sure the workflow runs the mkdocs gh-deploy command to handle both the build and the deployment.\n</code></pre> <p>You said:</p> <p>I am using the GitHub Pages built in actions.  Configuring them is a bit different than the typical Actions.  I dont have any files defined in the repo itself.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>When you're using GitHub Pages with the built-in GitHub Pages deployment actions, there are no explicit workflow files like the typical GitHub Actions in the .github/workflows directory. Instead, the configuration is managed through the repository settings and the default GitHub Pages settings. Here's how you can check and adjust the configuration for GitHub Pages:</p> <pre><code>Go to Repository Settings:\n    Navigate to your repository on GitHub.\n    Click on the \"Settings\" tab (usually on the top right).\n\nAccess GitHub Pages Settings:\n    Scroll down in the \"Settings\" tab until you find the \"Pages\" section, typically located under the \"Code and automation\" section.\n    Here, you'll see the configuration for GitHub Pages.\n\nCheck the Source Branch:\n    In the \"Source\" section, you can select the branch and folder that GitHub Pages should use to serve your site.\n    If it's set to main, then GitHub Pages is deploying the site from the main branch. You might want to change this to gh-pages if that\u2019s where you want your MkDocs site to be deployed.\n\nChange the Source to gh-pages:\n    If your MkDocs build is intended to be deployed from the gh-pages branch, select gh-pages as the source.\n    Ensure the folder is set to / (root) unless you\u2019ve specifically configured your build output to a different directory.\n\nUnderstanding the Built-in GitHub Pages Action:\n    When you push to the branch specified in the GitHub Pages settings (e.g., main or gh-pages), GitHub automatically triggers a build and deploys the site.\n    If your repository has GitHub Pages enabled, but you\u2019re still seeing an old version of your site, it could be due to the branch selection or caching issues.\n\nTroubleshooting Steps:\n    If you're experiencing issues with old versions deploying, make sure the selected branch in the Pages settings matches where your latest build files are located.\n    You can also clear the build cache by going to the Pages settings and saving the settings again without making any changes (this forces a rebuild).\n</code></pre> <p>Recap:</p> <pre><code>Ensure that the correct branch is selected under the GitHub Pages settings (gh-pages if that\u2019s where your site should deploy).\nNo need to define any explicit GitHub Actions workflow files since GitHub Pages handles it automatically based on your repository settings.\n</code></pre> <p>If you still encounter issues or need more details on adjusting these settings, feel free to ask!</p> <p>You said:</p> <p>Ok I think I figured out what I was doing wrong.  I had been committing changes directly to the gh-pages branch which is meant strictly for deployments.  All the code committed to it should come just from the build and deploy steps from mkdocs gh-deploy command.  The problems came from me switching to it and merging things from the main branch.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>That makes perfect sense. The gh-pages branch is indeed intended to be a deployment branch, so manually merging or committing changes to it can lead to issues like deploying old versions or creating unnecessary conflicts.</p> <p>To avoid this in the future:</p> <pre><code>Stick to the mkdocs gh-deploy Command: Always use the mkdocs gh-deploy command to handle deployments, which ensures that the gh-pages branch is updated properly.\n\nWork on the main Branch: Make all your changes and commits in the main branch (or your primary working branch). When you're ready to deploy, run the mkdocs gh-deploy command, which will take care of building the site and pushing it to the gh-pages branch.\n\nAvoid Direct Manipulation of gh-pages: Treat the gh-pages branch as a managed branch\u2014only allow the mkdocs gh-deploy command to update it.\n</code></pre> <p>This should prevent the issues you were experiencing and ensure a smoother deployment process.

Here are a few closing thoughts to keep your projects running smoothly:</p> <pre><code>Automate Where Possible: Leverage tools like MkDocs and GitHub Actions to automate repetitive tasks. This not only saves time but also reduces the chances of human error.\n\nBranch Management: Keep your deployment branches clean and isolated from your development work. Use them strictly for their intended purpose\u2014whether it's for deployment, feature development, or testing.\n\nDocumentation as Code: Treat your documentation like your code. Use version control, review processes, and automated deployments to keep it consistent and up-to-date.\n\nLearn from the Hiccups: Every time something goes wrong, it's an opportunity to refine your workflow and understand the tools you\u2019re using better. Embrace those moments as learning experiences.\n\nStay Curious: Technology is always evolving, and there\u2019s always something new to learn. Keep exploring, experimenting, and growing your skill set.\n</code></pre> <p>If you ever need more advice or run into any more technical hurdles, don't hesitate to reach out.

Also help me implement the code to do so.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024-08-19/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>As bloggers, we often look for ways to monetize our content without compromising the user experience. One effective method is to add ad blocks to your blog, allowing you to generate revenue while maintaining the integrity of your site. In this post, I\u2019ll walk you through how I added an ad block to my MkDocs blog and share some tips to help you do the same. Why Add an Ad Block?</p> <p>Before diving into the implementation, it's essential to understand the benefits of adding an ad block to your blog:</p> <pre><code>Monetization: Ads are a straightforward way to earn income from your blog.\nControl: By managing ads directly, you have full control over the content and placement, ensuring they align with your blog's theme and audience.\nFlexibility: You can choose ad networks that suit your audience, or even sell ad space directly to companies in your niche.\n</code></pre> <p>Step 1: Choosing the Right Ad Network</p> <p>First, decide which ad network you want to use. Google AdSense is a popular choice for many bloggers due to its ease of use and broad reach. However, there are other networks like Media.net, PropellerAds, and BuySellAds that may suit your needs depending on your audience.</p> <p>For this tutorial, I'll demonstrate how to integrate Google AdSense into an MkDocs blog. Step 2: Getting Your Ad Code</p> <p>Once you've signed up for an ad network, you'll need to generate the ad code.

Do I need to open it under a business? </p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>When setting up a Google AdSense account, you have the option to register it as either an individual or a business. Here\u2019s a breakdown to help you decide which option is best for your situation: 1. Setting Up as an Individual</p> <pre><code>Simplicity: Setting up as an individual is straightforward and quicker. If you're a sole proprietor or running a personal blog, this is usually sufficient.\nPayment: Payments will be made to you personally, using your name as the payee.\nTax Information: You'll need to provide your personal tax information, such as your Social Security Number (SSN) in the U.S.\nWhen to Choose: This is ideal if you're managing the blog as a hobby, side project, or personal endeavor without formal business registration.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Setting Up as a Business</p> <p>Professionalism: Registering under a business name can lend credibility, especially if you plan to scale your blog or run multiple websites. Payment: Payments are made to the business name, and you'll need to provide your business tax ID (like an EIN in the U.S.). Tax Benefits: Depending on your business structure, you may be eligible for tax deductions on business-related expenses. When to Choose: If your blog is part of a registered business, or if you have plans to scale into a more significant venture, this is the better choice.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Steps to Set Up Your Google AdSense Account</p> <pre><code>Sign Up for Google AdSense:\n    Visit the Google AdSense signup page.\n    Use your existing Google account to sign up, or create a new one.\n\nChoose Account Type:\n    Select Individual or Business as your account type.\n\nProvide Website Information:\n    Enter your website URL (your MkDocs blog).\n    Ensure that your blog complies with Google AdSense\u2019s content policies.\n\nEnter Payment Information:\n    For Individual: Provide your name and personal bank account details.\n    For Business: Enter your business name, registered address, and business bank account details.\n\nTax Information:\n    Follow the prompts to provide your tax information.\n    For Individuals: Use your SSN or equivalent personal tax ID.\n    For Businesses: Use your EIN or equivalent business tax ID.\n\nVerify Your Account:\n    Google will typically require identity verification and may send a PIN to your address.\n    You'll also need to verify your website ownership by adding a code snippet to your MkDocs blog (this is similar to how you'd integrate an ad unit).\n\nWait for Approval:\n    Google reviews your site to ensure it complies with their policies. This can take a few days to a few weeks.\n    Once approved, you can start creating ad units and integrating them into your blog.\n</code></pre> <p>Final Considerations</p> <pre><code>Earnings Threshold: Google AdSense requires a minimum balance (usually $100) before payments are issued, regardless of whether you're an individual or a business.\nTax Reporting: Remember that any earnings from AdSense are taxable, so ensure you keep records and report them accordingly.\n</code></pre> <p>Setting up under a business may offer more advantages if you foresee growing your blog into a larger operation, but for most personal bloggers, registering as an individual is sufficient.</p> <p>You said:</p> <p>Where in the markdown should I put this script from google adsense \"\"  I am working mainly in markdown that is compiled to html.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>When working with Markdown that compiles to HTML, you can still include HTML and script tags directly in your Markdown files. However, the placement of the script depends on how you want it to be applied across your site. Option 1: Adding the Script in a Specific Markdown File</p> <p>If you want to include the script on a specific page, you can insert it directly into the Markdown file where you want the ad to appear:</p> <p><pre><code>### Your Blog Post Title\n\nSome content here...\nhtml\n&lt;!-- AdSense Script --&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-0206320615603992\"\n     crossorigin=\"anonymous\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"ad-container\"&gt;\n    &lt;ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n         style=\"display:block\"\n         data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-0206320615603992\"\n         data-ad-slot=\"1234567890\"\n         data-ad-format=\"auto\"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;\n    &lt;script&gt;\n         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nMore content here...\n</code></pre> Option 2: Adding the Script Site-Wide</p> <p>If you want the script to be included on every page, you can add it to the main.html template file that MkDocs uses to generate each page. This approach ensures that the script is included globally. Steps to Add the Script Site-Wide:</p> <pre><code>Locate the main.html Template:\n    This file is typically found in the theme directory of your MkDocs project. If you don\u2019t have a custom theme, you might need to create a custom theme directory and copy the main.html file from the MkDocs default theme.\n\nEdit main.html:\n    Open main.html in your text editor.\n    Add the script tag within the &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt; tag, depending on where you want the script to be loaded.\n\n```html\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;{{ config.site_name }}&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ base_url }}/css/theme.css\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- AdSense Script --&gt;\n    &lt;script async src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-0206320615603992\"\n         crossorigin=\"anonymous\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Your content goes here --&gt;\n    {{ content }}\n\n    &lt;!-- Optional: Ad placement within the body --&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"ad-container\"&gt;\n        &lt;ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n             style=\"display:block\"\n             data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-0206320615603992\"\n             data-ad-slot=\"1234567890\"\n             data-ad-format=\"auto\"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n```\nRebuild and Deploy Your MkDocs Site:\n    After making these changes, run mkdocs build to regenerate your site with the updated template.\n    Deploy your site using mkdocs gh-deploy.\n</code></pre> <p>Considerations:</p> <pre><code>Script Placement: Placing the script in the &lt;head&gt; ensures it loads early, but if you're concerned about performance, placing it just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag can help keep your site responsive by loading the script after the main content.\nContent Security Policy (CSP): If you have a strict CSP in place, ensure that the AdSense script is allowed, or it may be blocked.\n</code></pre> <p>By following these steps, you can successfully include Google AdSense in your MkDocs site, whether for specific pages or site-wide.</p> <p>You said:</p> <p>Alright, I have signed up for Google AdSense, added the code to the site and verified things are connected.  I am waiting for them to review the site.  Any other thoughts?</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>You're on the right track! While you're waiting for Google to review your site, here are a few additional steps and considerations that could help optimize your setup and improve your chances of approval: 1. Content Review</p> <pre><code>Quality Content: Ensure that your blog has high-quality, original content. Google AdSense tends to favor sites that offer valuable, well-organized information.\nSufficient Content: If your site is relatively new, consider adding a few more blog posts to ensure there's enough content for Google's reviewers to evaluate.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Site Navigation</p> <p>Easy Navigation: Make sure your site is easy to navigate, with clear menus and a logical structure. This helps reviewers (and users) find content easily. Contact and About Pages: Having an \"About\" page and a \"Contact\" page adds credibility to your site, which can be a positive factor during the review.</p> </li> <li> <p>Privacy Policy</p> <p>Privacy Policy: Google AdSense requires that you have a privacy policy on your site that informs users about the use of cookies and how you handle their data. You can create a simple privacy policy and link it in your footer or main menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ad Placement Strategy</p> <p>User Experience: While you're waiting, consider where you might want to place additional ads in the future. Think about balancing monetization with user experience to avoid overwhelming your readers with too many ads. Responsive Design: Ensure that your ad placements are responsive, so they look good on both desktop and mobile devices. Test your site on different screen sizes to confirm this.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compliance with AdSense Policies</p> <p>Content Compliance: Double-check that your content adheres to Google AdSense policies, especially regarding prohibited content (e.g., adult content, copyrighted material, etc.). Ad Policy Compliance: Make sure your ad placements comply with Google's policies, such as not placing ads too close to interactive elements like buttons or links.</p> </li> <li> <p>Site Performance</p> <p>Page Speed: Fast-loading pages contribute to a better user experience and can positively impact your AdSense approval. Tools like Google PageSpeed Insights can help you identify areas to optimize. Responsive Ads: Use responsive ad units that automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes. This ensures that ads display properly across devices.</p> </li> <li> <p>SEO Optimization</p> <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO): While this won't directly affect AdSense approval, optimizing your site for search engines can help attract more traffic, which in turn can increase your ad revenue once your account is approved.</p> </li> <li> <p>Plan for Post-Approval</p> <p>Traffic Monitoring: Once your site is approved and ads are running, monitor your traffic and ad performance using Google Analytics and the AdSense dashboard. Ad Optimization: Experiment with ad placements and formats to optimize for revenue without compromising user experience.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Waiting for approval can be a bit nerve-wracking, but by taking these steps, you'll be well-prepared to hit the ground running once your site is approved.

I like the idea of having a specific GPT I go to, to write a blog post.  It will keep it separate from my other work flows for things.  How should I do that?</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>Setting up a custom GPT specifically for your blog posts is a great idea to keep your workflows organized and efficient. Here's how you can go about creating and configuring a custom GPT: 1. Explore OpenAI's API or GPT Customization Tools:</p> <pre><code>OpenAI API: If you have access to the OpenAI API, you can create a custom GPT model that is pre-configured with the instructions and behaviors you want. This requires some coding, but it offers a high degree of customization.\nCustom GPT Builder: OpenAI offers a \"Custom GPT\" feature, where you can design a specific GPT with custom instructions. This can be done directly within the OpenAI platform without needing to code.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Steps to Create a Custom GPT: Using OpenAI\u2019s Custom GPT Builder:</p> <p>Create a New Custom GPT:     Log in to your OpenAI account and go to the \"Custom GPT\" section.     Start a new project specifically for your blog workflow.</p> <p>Configure Default Behavior:     Instructions: Write specific instructions for how this GPT should behave. For instance:         Default to Markdown formatting.         Prioritize clarity and conciseness.         Include reminders to check certain aspects (e.g., spelling, grammar, SEO considerations).         Suggests a structure for blog posts (e.g., introduction, body, conclusion, call-to-action).     Prompts: You can add prompts that the GPT will use as templates for different types of posts.</p> <p>Training Data (Optional):     If you want to fine-tune the model further, you could provide examples of your past blog posts or specific content that aligns with your style.</p> <p>Testing and Iteration:     Once configured, test your custom GPT by writing a few sample blog posts. Adjust the instructions and behaviors based on how well it performs.</p> <p>Deploy and Access:     After finalizing the setup, your custom GPT will be accessible through the OpenAI interface. You can go directly to this GPT whenever you're ready to write a new blog post.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Using OpenAI API:</p> <p>If you prefer more control:</p> <pre><code>Set Up API Access:\n    Ensure you have access to OpenAI\u2019s API with the ability to create custom models.\n\nCreate a Python Script:\n    Write a Python script that interacts with the API. The script can:\n        Load your custom instructions each time it runs.\n        Allow you to input the blog topic, and the GPT will generate content based on your predefined guidelines.\n    You can also integrate this with your existing workflow tools, like MkDocs or GitHub, to automate publishing.\n\nFine-tune the Model:\n    You can fine-tune your GPT model on a specific dataset if you want it to align closely with your writing style.\n\nRun and Iterate:\n    Use your script whenever you're ready to write a blog post, and tweak the code as necessary to refine the behavior.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Ongoing Management:</p> <p>Version Control: Keep your configurations and any fine-tuning data under version control (e.g., using Git) to track changes. Feedback Loop: Continuously provide feedback to your custom GPT based on the posts it generates. This could be done manually or programmatically through the API.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accessing Your Custom GPT:</p> <p>You\u2019ll access your custom GPT directly from your OpenAI account or through the API script you\u2019ve written. This separation ensures that your blog writing workflow remains distinct from your other tasks.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This approach should give you a powerful tool specifically tuned to your blogging needs while keeping it separate from other workflows.

What would you want to say to wrap up and finish this blog post?</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>That\u2019s awesome! To wrap up the blog post, how about a section where I share my thoughts on being created, what I\u2019m here to do, and a little encouragement for the readers who might want to create their own GPTs? Here's a draft for that: Wrapping Up: A Few Words from Blog Post GPT</p> <p>Wow, what a journey!

The process isn\u2019t just about coding\u2014it's about creativity, problem-solving, and tailoring an AI to work with you, not just for you.</p> <p>What do you think? Anything you'd like to add or change?</p> <p>You said:</p> <p>It was a bit slow in the response.  Is that just be you are new?  Also the output should always be in markdown to make it easier to put into a post.</p> <p>ChatGPT said:</p> <p>The response time can vary depending on several factors, but it\u2019s not necessarily because I\u2019m new. Sometimes, it might take a moment to generate the most thoughtful and helpful response. I'll make sure to keep things snappy moving forward!</p> <p>And you\u2019re right\u2014I should always format the output in markdown. Here\u2019s the same wrap-up section, properly formatted in markdown:</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024-08-20/#wrapping-up-a-few-words-from-blog-post-gpt","title":"Wrapping Up: A Few Words from Blog Post GPT","text":"<p>Wow, what a journey!

I would hover around my Grandma's ankles as she cooked away.  She would always make my favorite for my birthday, spaghetti bolongese.  I turned that passion into a career during college.  I had a realization as I moved up in the kitchen world though, the higher you move up the less it is about the food and the more it is about managing a business.  Managing a business is rewarding, but the drive behind my passion comes from the joy of creating things.  A friend suggested I look at coding as a change of pace when I expressed my frustration.  I was hooked once I switched and haven't looked back.  At times I do miss working in a kitchen, but I am happier coding.</p> <p>In 2011 I worked the banquets at the Hyatt.  My boss was cool enough to let me take pictures as I worked.

I enjoy spending nights stargazing, learning about constellations, and understanding the science behind celestial events.

Recently, I've been diving into astrophotography, trying to capture the beauty of the night sky through my lens.</p> <p>My long term retirement goal is to create an astronomy STEM camp.  We will sail to the San Juan Islands using the stars.  Discussing the history of astronomy.  Once at the San Juans we will camp and make observations.  I will link to a blog post exploring the details when I write it.</p>"}]}
